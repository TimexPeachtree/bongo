i18n in Bongo
=============

Small guide for i18n in Bongo:

bongo.pot contains the canonical source of translatable strings.
This can be updated with "make bongo.pot".

To make a new translation, make sure bongo.pot is up-to-date, and then
`msginit -o $lang.po` when in the po/ directory, where $lang is the
two-letter language code, Eg. fr, de, ru.. Note, that if no output
file is given, it will create a po file based on your locale setting.
Once you've created this file, translate each string as normal.

To update a .po file, simply execute "make update-po". This will update
bongo.pot, and then merge any new changes into all the po files.

To create the binary gmo files, simply call "make update-gmo". This will not
alter any pot or po file.
