01: Currently the NetMail agents signal handling for SIGHUP is not
    fully implemented.  We need to establish uniform signal handling
    for SIGHUP, SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 as appropriate.

02: An MDBPAM driver would be more appropriate than the simple MDBFIle
    driver.

03: The MDBFile driver is not multi-app multi-thread safe for read and
    write access.

04: The anti-virus agent needs to use an open source anti-virus engine
    as an example.

05: Add backwards API compatibility for old SDK based components.

06: Instrument use of OpenLDAP in place of our old LDAP library.

07: Run as non-root user.

08: src/agents/nmap/nmapc.h is empty

09: The managed client library needs to use the connection manager library.

10: We need to identify and resolve 'fixme' comments.

10: The connection management library needs:
        a:  exclusive BUFSIZE defintion as it is defined in most private 
            header files.
        b:  exclusive MTU definition as it is defined in most private
            header files.

11: Source code scrubbing definition:
        :  DOS2Unix the source and make files.
        :  Replace TAB characters with 4 spaces.
        :  Ensure that the first directive in the source files is:
            #include <config.h>
        :  Replace BUFSIZE with CONN_BUFSIZE as defined in connio.h
        :  Remove BUFSIZE definitions from source files.
        :  Replace MTU with CONN_TCP_MTU as defined in connio.h
        :  Remove MTU definitions from source files.
        :  Remove NMLOGID_H_NEED_LOGGING_KEY and NMLOGID_H_NEED_LOGGING_CERT 
            as they are now handled by the logging library.
        :  Re-format the source files.
        :  Defines should be grouped together; preferrable in the private 
            header file as appropriate.
        :  The ChopNL macro is repeatedly defined; this definition exists in
            connio.h as CHOP_NEWLINE; convert usage.
            
            Should this macro be in the cross platform headers?
        :  The SetPtrToValue macro is repeatedly defined across binaries; 
            however, it does not appear in any source file?

            This definition exists in connio.h at this time as 
            SET_POINTER_TO_VALUE.

            Should this macro be retained in the cross platform headers?
        :  Strucuture definitions should be grouped together; preferrably in
            the private header file as appropriate.
        :  Move global variables to a binary name based structure and:
            If single source file; leave structure definition in that file.

            If multiple source files; move structure definition to the
            private header file; setup an extern of the structue which
            should be in the main source file.

            Globals for thread ID's are commonly defined as 'int' and not
            XplThreadID.  Convert definitions such as:

                    int Tid;
                    int TGid;

                    to:

                    struct {
                        XplThreadID main;
                        XplThreadID group;
                    } id;

            Adjust global variable names and usage appropriately.
        :  Base64Chars[], DecodeBase64() and EncodeBase64() are commonly
            occurring in the binaries.  Should this be moved to a utility 
            library?
        :  Remove inappropriate code comments and reformat those left behind
            as directed.
        :  Convert BUG comments to fixme.
        :  For defined strings; use sizeof(string) - 1 in place of a defined length.
        :  Remove old connection i/o handling routines and definitions as
            directed (using little optimizations along the way?):

12: We need to resolve PRODUCT_VERSION definitions and use.

13: Improve client connection state processing
