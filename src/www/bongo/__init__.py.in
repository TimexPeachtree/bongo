# THIS FILE SHOULD NOT BE INSTALLED!

# It exists only to merge the src/www/bongo and src/libs/python/bongo
# directories in the Bongo source tree together.  In an installed
# system, they're going to be in the same place.

# add the other bongo directory to this module's path
__path__.append(__path__[0] + "/../../libs/python/bongo")

# the libs bongo/__init__.py will be appended here
