I am quite impressed by how far along this schedule is. I thought we'd
still be using CVS for some time now.

I AM PRECLARIFYING THIS WITH THE WARNING THAT THIS IS NOT A "I THINK WE
SHOULD HAVE USED SCM x" THREAD AND ANYONE WHO TURNS IT INTO THAT WILL BE
PERSONALLY HUNTED DOWN AND STONED.

With that in mind, and since I couldn't find it on the wiki. I was
wondering what reasons we have chosen to go with Subversion over other
popular contenders.

Again, no one say "oh, we should have used {Mercurial, Bazaar-ng, &c.}
instead". I only want the list of strengths that Ross and his team
identified so those strengths (and possible weaknesses) can be used in
other people's SCM analyses in the future.
