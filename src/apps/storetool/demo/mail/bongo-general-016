Dave,
  Below is my drafted response to the Branch Roadmap request. Thank you
for reviewing it. Please reply with any alterations, and/or the goahead.

Andras,

  We are focused on getting all of our branch work stable and complete
enough to merge into the trunk.  Of course, it is difficult to say
exactly when the merge will happen. We are currently working toward an
early August merge date.

  Thank you for your continued interest.

~Ty
