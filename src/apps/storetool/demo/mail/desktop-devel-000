Your app was already broken. The new version of intltool exposes a bug
in your app, which you should fix in your app. And yes, every variable
written in a configure.in file should survive being passed to sed. You
are not a user who shouldn't care what autotools does or does not do.
You are a developer who is using autotools as one of the tools for
maintaining a piece of software. If you don't care to know what the tool
you are using does or does not do, you shouldn't use it. Would you build
a house without knowing how a hammer works?

A bug in libc is a bug in libc, regardless of how your code exposes it.
If a change in glib to fix a bug, breaks the code you had to work
around the bug, because the data you are passing is bad, doesn't mean
glib should let you pass bad data. The bug is in glibc, and I wouldn't
call it a regression. Not supporting broken code is not a regresssion.
