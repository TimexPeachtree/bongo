CPE Lyon has agreed to host the event for costs - essentially the security
guard. We have been working with them on hosting GUADEC for several months, and
we will have all of the university's facilities available to us for the
conference, and will likely have someone from the university working part-time
on the conference organisation. This is the same place where we help the Libre
Graphics Meeting in March, and the total costs for the site for that event were
€475 for one security guard for two days.

Cheers,
Dave.
