Lionel,

The spamassassin issue is probably my fault.   I changed the way that
spamassassin is configured in revision 1445.   I have updated the wiki
(http://www.bongo-project.org/Setting_Up_SpamAssassin) to show how the
new configuration works.

The changes were motivated by two issues:
1. On busy bongo queues, one spamd server may not be able to keep up.
The configuration has been modified to allow the antispam agent to take
advantage of any number of spamd servers.  An entire dual cpu box was
dedicated to running spamd for myrealbox.com and it could not keep up.
With this new code, it is currently running with cycles to spare on two
dedicated spamd servers.  

2. There has been interest in adding additional technology options like
DSPAM to the antispam agent.  SpamAssassin configuration has been moved
to its own attribute (bongospamd) so that more than one scanning service
can be added without conflicts caused by using the common attribute of
novonyx:configuration.  The code was also refactored to make it easier
to add new spam engines.

Sorry about the inconvenience, but it will lead to more options for bongo
administrators.
