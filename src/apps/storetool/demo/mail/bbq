Hello!

As you may or may not be aware, you will be coming to my house today.
You will have a pleasant time (it's MFBT), eat grilled things, and so
on.  The weather is apparently *not* going to suck today, as was
previously expected, so you might even be able to sit outside (pending
my cleaning of my picnic table).

"Are you insane," you may ask, "announcing a bbq for the same day?"
And the answer, my friends, is yes.

Now, the when:  3PM seems to be an agreeable time to almost everyone,
but if you want to arrive before or after, that is OK.

The where:  My place.

What to bring: I think we have most things covered, but if you really
want to, go for snacks, beer, or anything unusual you want grilled
(veggies count as 'unusual' for Venezuelans, be warned).

Hope you can make it.

Dan
