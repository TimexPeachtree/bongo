Hi people

There is a bug #329897 which asks to add the current layout indication
to the gnome-screensaver. This requires some information (localized
layout names) from huge xorg.xml file which is usually (but not always
- applets are not mandatory) already loaded by the keyboard indicator
panel applet. Doing the same job twice in two apps (and using two
times more memory) does not look nice. So, here are the questions:
1. Which process would be a proper place for keeping loaded layout's
tree? Should it be g-s-d or something else?
2. Is DBUS the best protocol nowadays for providing access to such informat=
ion?

Any comments, architectural ideas are very welcome.

Sergey
