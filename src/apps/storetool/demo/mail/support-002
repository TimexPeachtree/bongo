Subject: Seeking Virtual B3, Guitar Xtreme! updates

Hello -

I'm trying to track down the updates for Virtual B3 and Guitar Xtreme!
included with Everything 3.

I registered Everything on February 3, but haven't heard anything about
the updates.  I filed a support request (#15517) on March 16, but
didn't get a reply.  A followup on April 10 yielded the suggestion
that I get in touch with US sales.  So, here I am.  Can you help me?

Thanks,
@NAME@
